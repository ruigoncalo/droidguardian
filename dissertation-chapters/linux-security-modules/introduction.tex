In 2001, Peter Loscocco and Stephen Smalley wrote an article introducing the \textit{\gls{sel}} \cite{LS01}. The main reason that led to the development of such mechanism was the flawed assumption that adequate security should reside in applications, leaving the role of the operating system behind \cite{LSMTTF98}. They supported the idea that secure applications require secure operating systems. A strong concept related to operating systems security is \textit{access control policy}. In a simple manner, this term specifies which of the operations associated with an object are authorized to perform. Linux kernel inherited from the UNIX security model the \textit{\gls{dac}} that allows the owner of an object to set the security policy for that object (the control of access is based on the discretion of the owner). However, this model of access control brings some advantages. For instance, every program executed by a certain user receives all of the privileges associated with that user. Therefore it is able to change the permissions of all user's objects, creating potential security threats. In this sense, a \textit{\gls{mac}} was purposed to protect the system against vulnerabilities left by other access control models. In \gls{mac} the operating system constrains the ability of a subject to perform an operation on an object, depending on the security attributes. Whenever a subject attempts to access an object, an authorization rule enforced by the operating system kernel checks these security attributes in order to allow or deny the access.\\

At the Linux Kernel 2.5 Summit, the \gls{nsa}, based on the security issues previously mentioned, presented their work on \gls{sel}, a security mechanism of a flexible access control architecture in the Linux kernel. \gls{nsa} reiterated the need for such support in the mainstream Linux kernel. Other projects were presented to enforce access policies, namely \gls{dte}, \gls{lids} and POSIX.1e capabilities. Given these projects, Linus Torvalds decided to provide a general framework for security policy, named \gls{lsm}. This framework allow many different access control models to be implemented as loadable kernel modules. Linus enforced that \gls{lsm} should be truly generic, where using a different security model was a question of loading a different kernel module. The framework should also be conceptually simple, minimally invasive and efficient. At last, the mechanism should be able to support the POSIX.1e capabilities logic as an optional security module \cite{WCSMK02}.\\

\noindent
This security framework has motivated developers and gave them freedom to build their own \gls{lsm} according to how they consider kernel objects should be accessed. \gls{sel}\footnote{http://selinuxproject.org} was originally made by the \gls{nsa} and has been in the mainstream kernel since version 2.6 (December 2003). This module gives executables the minimum privileges required to complete their tasks...\\

\textit{AppArmor (Application Armor)}\footnote{http://wiki.apparmor.net} was originally developed by \textit{Immunix}, which was a commercial operating system acquired by \textit{Novell} in 2005. Novell laid off AppArmor programmers in 2007, but they continued the work. Since 2009, \textit{Canonical} contributes to the project. This module has been in the mainstream Linux kernel since version 2.6.36 (October 2010). While \gls{sel} is based on applying labels to files, AppArmor operates with file paths. Many Linux administrators claim that AppArmor is the easiest security module to configure. Yet, others state that it is the worst security mechanism compared to alternatives.\\

TODO:\\
Talk about the types of LSM!\\
They are not actually kernel modules anymore!
