\chapter{Quimera Grading System}\label{a:quim}

\quim\ user interface offers a simple and intuitive way to set up and manage contests, complemented with an extended feature for assessing and grading programming exercises.
By combining a powerful source code analysis with the traditional dynamic analysis, this system offers a complete overview of the source code quality complemented with a
detailed feedback about each submitted solution.
From a simple exercise resolution in a programming course to a contest management, \quim\ offers to the contest Teachers/Judges an automatic grading system which avoids the classical manual source code analysis.
This Appendix presents a detailed description of this system and its major features.
