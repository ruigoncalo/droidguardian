Mobile devices running Android operating system are increasingly used to surf the web, and, generally speaking, to access a broad spectrum of network-based services. Its successful deployment as a mobile platform, however, also means it is an increasingly relevant target of malicious efforts that try to identify and exploit its vulnerabilities, and to gain access to valuable personal and organizational data. On the other hand, Android OS-based devices could be used as a valuable on-site security auditing tool, but lack a set of coherent and fully functional applications, specially developed for this inherently resource-constrained platform.

The ultimate goal of this project is to start the development of a set of coherent and integrated tools that, ultimately, will enable Android OS-based devices to be used in network security auditing. These tools will include traffic filtering, network mapping, vulnerability assessment and intrusion detection. This project will also help identify and raise awareness to current network-based threats to Android OS-based devices.
