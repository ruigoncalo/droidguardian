DroidGuardian aims to provide a fine-grained control over internet connections on Android devices. This feature allows users to be aware of how applications behave in terms of outgoing connections that usually occur hidden and unnoticed. Most of the times it is supposed to be like that. Internet connections are a mean to get and send data, quickly, secretly and efficiently. However, the user, as the device's owner, should know what is going under the hood if he desires to. Should be able to find out what connections are applications that live inside his device doing.
